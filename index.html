    <p>Please examine our website to become acquainted, but better still come and visit us for any of our services. The <a href="/about">About</a> tab includes a comprehensive presentation about the Orthodox Christian Church, our <a href="/bulletin">Bulletin</a> tab lets you read the most recent and immediately past editions of our Bulletin. And our Resources tab provides information for Youth, information on the Scrip program, another way of supporting the parish financially while doing our regular shopping. Additionally, an up to date Liturgical Resources page with propers for the Sunday services of the year is found in our Resources tab. This latter project is ongoing and increasingly inclusive. Our website is an ongoing and ever expanding resource, visit us often.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting St. Mark's virtually. We look forward to welcoming you in the flesh.</p>
    <p>In the Incarnate Word of God,<br />
        Fr. Martin and the Faithful of St. Mark's</p>
